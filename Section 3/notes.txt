Conditionals

1. v-if - can be added to any element or paragraph. Resolves to true or false in the end (connected to vue data).
        - V-if detaches and attaches (completely removes them)
        - can be extended with v-else or another v-if (there is no v-else-if, CHANGED in vue js 2.1. There is now v-else-if)
        - also affects all nested elements

2. template - doesnt get rendered in the DOM
            - attach v-if to template (takes advantage of affecting nested element, a grouping of sorts)
            - works like a div without the side effects

3. v-show - works similarly but KEEPS the elements, just shows and hides them (unlike v-if that completely removes them)

Lists

1. v-for    - loop through an array and replicate an element as often as needed
            - pull out content in the array and use it in the template

            getting the index -> original synthax for v-for

                    v-for="ingredient in ingredients"

                    with index
                    
                    v-for="(ingredient, i) in ingredients"

                    (element, index) <-always arranged like this

2. template - to group the info so you can use the element and index in different HTML elements

Looping is available for arrays single elements, arrays that hold objects, or objects themselves
